==================

Code for our website.

Hosted by Github Pages. Powered by Jekyll.

## How to hack on the code
Ruby and Jekyll are required.
If you don't already have Ruby, I'd suggest using [RVM](https://rvm.io) to install and manage it. It's so much easier to update and manage Ruby with RVM, not to mention not needing root access on your computer.
Get Jekyll like this: `gem install jekyll`.

Pull the repo: `git clone https://github.com/MadCityFolders/madcityfolders.github.io.git`.
Run a Jekyll server: `jekyll server`.
Run a (watching) Jekyll server: `jekyll server --watch`.
