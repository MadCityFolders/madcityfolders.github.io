## Folding for a Better World: An MLK Jr. Day Origami Celebration

We ran an event celebrating Martin Luther King, Jr. on Monday January 18, 2015 at the Middleton Public Library.
Participants got a chance to create a public art piece to be displayed at the library in honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. and his legacy.
Several paper folding projects were taught and participants could inscribe each with their favorite quote from Dr. King or another inspiring individual.
The individual pieces were arranged to create a public art piece in the libraryâ€™s Stairwell Gallery.

We hosted an "Origami Open House" on Saturday, December 12th, 2015 at the Middleton Public Library.
Origami artist and teacher Ruthanne Bessman and the Mad City Folders taught a variety of origami projects, such as flapping birds, boxes, jumping frogs, and envelopes.
Around 200 people came to learn how to fold!
