    <h2>Our history</h2>

    <p>In 2010, Shirwill Lukes, a set designer for WHA television, and
    Ruthanne Bessman, a classical music host on Wisconsin Public Radio (and an
    origami master who has studied in Japan and been on the board of OrigamiUSA)
    designed the mural displayed behind the circulation desk in the Middleton
    Public Library.</p>
    <p>The thousands of pieces that make up the mural were folded by community
    volunteers.<p>
    <p>The friendships that came out of this experience were the beginning of
    MadCity Folders, which has been meeting for the past 3+ years.</p>
