<span class="name-callout">MadCity Folders</span> is a diverse group of Madison-area origami enthusiasts who meet monthly to teach, share, and practice the art of origami.

We meet the second Monday of each month, at the Sequoya Library ([directions](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Madison+Public+Library:+Sequoya+Branch/@43.0342714,-89.4227239,12.75z)) from 6:30 to 8:30 PM.
Gather around a table, fold, talk, exchange ideas, bring your favorite books and projects to share! All ages welcome.

## Our history

In 2010, Shirwill Lukes, a set designer for WHA television, and
Ruthanne Bessman, a classical music host on Wisconsin Public Radio (and an
origami master who has studied in Japan and been on the board of OrigamiUSA)
designed the mural displayed behind the circulation desk in the Middleton
Public Library.
The thousands of pieces that make up the mural were folded by community
volunteers.

The friendships that came out of this experience were the beginning of
MadCity Folders, which has been meeting for the past 3+ years.
