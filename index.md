## Our history

In 2010, Shirwil Lukes, a set designer for WHA television, and
Ruthanne Bessman, a classical music host on Wisconsin Public Radio (and an
origami artist and teacher who has studied in Japan and been on the board of OrigamiUSA)
designed the mural displayed behind the circulation desk in the Middleton
Public Library.
The thousands of pieces that make up the mural were folded by community
volunteers.

The friendships that came out of this experience were the beginning of
MadCity Folders, which has been meeting for the past 4 years.
